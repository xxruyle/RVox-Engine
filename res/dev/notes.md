- Just started using pow()  to make the height maps better 
- Started messing with the octaves and the frequency. Low frequency and low octaves give a more gradual and sand dunes type look,
  - Low pow exponent combined with this gives planes. 
- High frequency high octaves gives rugged terrain with mountains
